Iron-Router Tutorial
====================
The Iron-Router is a "client and server side router designed specifically for Meteor". Before the Iron-Router there were two router that were most commonly used: Meteor-Router from Tom Coleman and Mini-Pages from Chris Mather. The learnings from those two routers are now combined into the Iron-Router project, created by Chris Mather and Tom Coleman. Also there is no router planned for the Meteor 1.0 release and it is not unrealistic that the Iron-Router will become the standard router package for Meteor. Because of this and also because the Iron-Router helps you a lot it is worth looking into it.
